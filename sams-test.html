    <h2>How to Shop For The Best Personal Care Products: Buying Guide</h2>
<p>
When shopping for personal care products, there can be a dizzying number of choices. From shampoo to hand sanitizer to bar soap to facial tissue to deodorant or antiperspirant, personal care products are any items that help to keep you comfortable, healthy and well. This category may include other things as well, like conditioner, shower gel, nitrile and latex gloves, menstrual products, moisturizing body lotion, rubbing alcohol, mouthwash, lip balm, shavers, electric toothbrushes, sunscreen, hair care and hydrogen peroxide.
</p>
<p>
When choosing personal care products, you may have a particular brand you prefer to purchase. Some brands, like Member's Mark, produce many personal care products, so it's possible to remain loyal to one brand whether you're buying oral care, hand lotion or bath and body products. Which personal care products are best depends on your budget, your needs and your personal preferences.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in purchasing Member's Mark personal care products, they are available at members-only prices at Sam's Club.
</p>
<h3>What Different Types of Personal Care Products Are There?</h3>
<p>
When you are buying bath and body products online, you might find it difficult to decide which items are right for you. There are many less common body care products like body oils and essential oils, bubble baths, body scrubs, bath salts, body cream and shea butter. But the basics remain the same: shampoo, soap and conditioner.
</p>
<h4>Shampoo and Conditioner</h4>
<p>
When it comes to shampoo and conditioner, you might wish for a basic product that is paraben free or unscented to wash your hair. Alternatively, you might be looking to find a hair product that is color safe. Member's Mark offers these and more shampoos and conditioners.
</p>
<h4>Body Wash</h4>
<p>
A body wash is a liquid soap that often has a fruity or floral scent. In other instances, body washes are made to have a masculine scent akin to an aftershave. Body wash can be applied with a bath sponge, washcloth or loofah.
</p>
<h4>Hand Soap and Sanitizer</h4>
<p>
Hand soap may come in a liquid or bar form and is used to keep your hands germ-free after cleaning, using the restroom or before you eat. Hand sanitizer offers similar benefits but is easily portable and can be used on-the-go for maximum convenience since no water is required.
</p>
<h4>Gloves</h4>
<p>
If you don't want to come into contact with chemicals while cleaning or need to prepare food for family members with allergies, you might choose to purchase nitrile or latex gloves. These personal care products are a great way to protect your skin and keep potentially dangerous substances away from food.
</p>
<h4>Menstrual Products</h4>
<p>
Menstrual products include sanitary napkins, pantiliners and tampons. Many women have a preferred product, while others choose to use a combination of these items depending on what they have planned for the day.
</p>
<h4>Lotion</h4>
<p>
Lotion for your face and body is an important skin care step. A moisturizer containing a sun protection SPF is a smart addition to your skin care routine, and it should be applied each day. Lotion is a great way to keep your skin smooth and itch-free, particularly in the wintertime when the air is dry.
</p>
<h4>Tissues</h4>
<p>
Facial tissue, which may come in small or large boxes or even plastic travel sleeves, are helpful for keeping your nasal passages clear when colds or allergies strike. Facial tissue may be extra soft, firm or even moisturized, so there are a variety of choices, depending on your preference. Cleanser wipes may be more effective for certain delicate jobs.
</p>
<h4>Rubbing Alcohol</h4>
<p>
Rubbing alcohol is a useful product to keep stocked in your medicine cabinet. It is a great tool for cleaning oral thermometers or applying to skin before you use a needle, like an insulin shot. In addition, rubbing alcohol has many household uses.
</p>
<h4>Hydrogen Peroxide</h4>
<p>
Hydrogen peroxide has a variety of cleaning applications, making it a wonderful addition to your pantry or medicine cabinet. In addition, many people use it to clean out small cuts or abrasions before applying a bandage to oxidize the wound and keep it germ-free.
</p>
<h4>Vitamins</h4>
<p>
Vitamins are another personal care product that you may wish to purchase. Vitamins serve as a supplement to the food you eat to ensure that you are consuming the correct quantities of certain essential substances. A multivitamin typically includes a safe quantity of many of the vitamins doctors recommend you get each day.
</p>
<p>
Some vitamins, like C, are water-soluble, which means you can consume them in large quantities and will excrete any extra that can't be absorbed. For this reason, a multivitamin may include 100% of the recommended daily value of such substances. Other vitamins, like E, are fat soluble, which means consuming excess could be harmful to your health. Multivitamins only contain some of the recommended daily values of this sort of substance. Consult with your doctor before beginning any vitamin regimen to determine what sort of multivitamin is the right choice for you.
</p>
<h3>What to Consider when Buying Personal Care Products</h3>
<p>
When it comes to buying personal care products, it's helpful to think through your day in its entirety. Start from the moment you wake and walk through your morning, afternoon and evening. What personal care tasks do you complete? For instance, when brushing your teeth, you use a toothbrush, toothpaste and dental floss. Those are three personal care items you will need to purchase and keep on hand. By considering the tasks you complete on a daily basis, you can easily decide which personal care products to keep on hand.
</p>
<p>
The more frequently you or a family member use these items, the greater the quantities you should stock them in. Additionally, consider the price of personal care items. If you can purchase items in bulk and have the space to store them, it may enable you to save money. Sam's Club offers members-only pricing, which can also cut down on your costs.

<h3>FAQ - Personal Care Products</h3>
<h4>How much do personal care products cost?</h4>
<p>
Personal care products range in price, depending on what you are purchasing and the brand you choose. You will likely save money on the unit price if you buy in bulk. For instance, if you are purchasing a large bottle of multivitamins, you are better off buying a pack of two if it brings the cost per vitamin down below the cost per vitamin in a single pack.
</p>
<h4>Are personal care products covered by insurance?</h4>
<p>
Some personal care products may be covered by your insurance company. Even if they are not covered up front, it's possible that you may be able to submit receipts and request reimbursement or use a Flex Spend account. Be sure to save documentation of the purchase of all your personal care products. This way, you can submit a request for a refund to your insurance company if such a program exists. Consult with an HR representative at your place of business or call your insurance company directly for more information.
